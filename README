This is a user program for interpreting key, shuttle, and jog events
from the following supported devices:

 - Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2
 - Contour Design ShuttleXpress
 - CAVS SpaceShuttle A/V

It translates these events into X keystrokes, mouse button presses, 
or scroll wheel events.

It was developed and tested on xubuntu 20.04.

ShuttlePRO events can generate sequences of multiple keystrokes,
including the pressing and releasing of modifier keys.  The binding
can be selected based on the title of the window which is focused.


Build instructions
==================
# apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev dpkg-dev fakeroot
# cd shuttleevent
# dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
# cd ..
# dpkg -i shuttleevent*deb


Configuration instructions
==========================

Copy the example.shuttlerc file to $HOME/.shuttlerc and edit it
there.  While you are configuring this file, you probably want to run
the "shuttleevent" binary from a terminal to see the program output.

The program re-reads the .shuttlerc file whenever it notices that the
file has been changed, but it only checks when a shuttle event is sent
with a different window focused from the previous shuttle event.  When
you save a new version of the .shuttlerc file, it is a good idea to
deliver shuttle events to two different windows to insure that the new
copy of your file is loaded.
